  Orocos Components
  =================

This directory consists of a series of independent Orocos
components which can be used to build a control application.

Structure:

reporting: [ready]
	Components for real-time data capturing. Currently console
	and file reporting is supported.

taskbrowser: [ready]
	A Component for online interaction with any other component.
	Your main tool during component development, testing or
	experimenting.

viewer: [beta stage]

hardware: [beta stage] Components for various devices (like sensors)
	and hardware platforms, the simulation devices can be used by
	everyone, the hardware robot, krypton and lasersensor devices
	only in our lab (KULeuven/PMA/robotics), the wrenchsensor
	component by everyone using the pci-interface to a JR3-sensor,
	the camera components for everyone using opencv, and the
	demotool components for everyone combining the wrench sensor
	and the krypton kamera system.
	

motion_control: [beta stage]
	Components for path interpolation, cartesian and joint space
	control

deployment: [alfa stage]
	Component for connecting and configuring an application.

kinematics: [alfa stage]
	Component for forward and reverse kinematics. Needs to
	be adapted to the KDL.
