THE SHORT VERSION
-----------------

Just do:

'cmake .'
'make'
(as root) 'make install'


THE LONG VERSION
----------------

* Orocos uses cmake (www.cmake.org) for its build configuration.
  CMake is a cross-platform build system. Use version 2.2 or 2.4.

* Orocos uses the 'pkg-config' program to detect installed libraries.

* This library requires that the Orocos RTT (liborocos-rtt) is installed.

* There are a few ways you can do things differently to the short version:

  1) Out-of-source builds:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

  2) Setting a different compiler:

	$ CC="distcc gcc-3.3" CXX="distcc g++-3.3" cmake ..

     or use the 'configure' wrapper script:

	$ ../configure CC="distcc gcc-3.3" CXX="distcc g++-3.3"

  3) GUI Configurator:

	Use 'ccmake' rather than 'cmake' for a text-based configurator.

  4) Packaging support:

	'make install DISTDIR=...."
