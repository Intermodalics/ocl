The makefile in this directory is meant for a 2.6.x kernel.

You should edit the CPPFLAGS in the makefile.

After this, you can compile the modules with

    make -C /usr/src/linux-2.6.9_hal-r10/ SUBDIRS=$PWD modules

    (with of course /usr/src/linux-2.6.9_hal-r10/ your
     kernel source directory)
