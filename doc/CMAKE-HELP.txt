 Getting HELP
##############

Use: 
$ man cmake

or after generating the Makefiles:
$ make help

The generated Makefiles are documented as well.

 VERBOSE OUTPUT
################

In order to 'see' what 'make' is doing, use:
$ make VERBOSE=1

This can be issued from the top level or every subdirectory.

 MACROS
########

The macros in the component subdirs are used from

config/component_rules.cmake:

#
# Components should add themselves by calling 'GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT' 
# instead of 'ADD_LIBRARY' in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# This gives a centralised location where all components are registered
# and lets us add various things to all components in just one place.
#
#
# Usage: GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT( COMPONENT_NAME src1 src2 src3 )
#
MACRO( GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT COMPONENT_NAME )

#
# Components should add tests by calling 'GLOBAL_ADD_TEST' 
# instead of 'ADD_EXECUTABLE' in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# This gives a centralised location where all tests are registered
# and lets us add various things to all components in just one place.
#
#
# Usage: GLOBAL_ADD_TEST( TEST_NAME src1 src2 src3 )
#
MACRO( GLOBAL_ADD_TEST TEST_NAME )


In addition, you can use the traditional CMake commmands, knowing that
COMPONENT_NAME is a library and TEST_NAME is an executable. Set your
editor\'s mode to 'shell-script' highlighting for better syntax highlighting.

To add a component\'s directory to the build system, see the bottom of
the top-level CMakeLists.txt for adding it with ADD_SUBDIRECTORY and
LINK_DIRECTORIES.
