To build the components do:

mkdir build
cd build
../configure --help
../configure --target=[gnulinux|lxrt|xenomai] --with-orocos=/usr/local/orocos

make

The configure and Makefile (generated by configure) are wrappers to 'waf',
a python based build system. It uses 'wscript' files instead of Makefiles,
and the syntax is 'automake'-like.
