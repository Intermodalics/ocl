         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v1.4.0

This release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at the
Real-Time Toolkit v1.4.0. and offers improved functionality for
loading and configuring components dynamically at run-time.  The OCL
major version (1.4) has been made identical to the RTT major version
in order to ease matching the correct versions of both libraries. Some
components of the OCL library are now also available as Debian 4.0
'Etch' packages from 
 deb http://svn.fmtc.be/debian etch main

A new stand-alone applications has been added as well:
 cdeployer: loads other components into the current process and
 is accessible over a network using the CORBA transport.

An overview of the components is available here:

         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v0.4.1

This release offers improvements to the TaskBrowser, Deployment and
Reporting component. The TaskBrowser shows an improved component
interface and status view upon the 'ls' command and also stores and
loads history of previous sessions to a history file, allowing you to
search, execute or list commands of previous sessions. The Deployment
component has been further tested and protects you against loading the
same library twice with different versions (which would cause a
crash).  The Reporting component outputs a new single line header,
starting with a hash (#) mark and naming the columns as in
'Component.Port.index', which allows greatly improved plotting with
the KDE 3 'kst' application.

The documentation had its gradual update as well.
